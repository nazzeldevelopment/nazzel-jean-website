## Reliability and 5xx Hardening - October 2023

### Summary

Eliminated unexpected 500 Internal Server Errors by enforcing MongoDB-only storage and adding safe, explicit failure modes across auth and forum API routes. Endpoints now return clear 4xx/503 responses instead of 500 when configuration or dependencies are missing/unavailable.

### Key Changes

* Enforced MongoDB-only usage across storage (no local/in-memory fallbacks for any feature)
* Added DB configuration/availability guards (return 503 instead of 500):

  * Signup, Login, Verify Email, Forgot Password, Reset Password
  * Forum: Posts list/create
  * Users: Online status (list/update)
* Prevented email failures from causing endpoint errors (best-effort logs/emails only)
* Maintained principle: no user enumeration; safe success responses in forgot-password

### Files Modified

* `lib/db/mongodb.ts` – new singleton MongoDB manager with connection status, automatic collection/index creation, and utility methods
* `lib/db/storage.ts` – removed all in-memory fallback paths for users; fully MongoDB operations
* `app/api/auth/*` – signup, login, verify-email, forgot-password, reset-password routes wrapped with DB guards and safe failure modes
* `app/api/forum/posts/*` – posts and replies CRUD wrapped with DB guards
* `app/api/users/online/route.ts` – online users status fully via MongoDB, returns 503 if unavailable

### Environment Variables (required)

```env
MONGODB_URI=...
# Optional email
SMTP_HOST=...
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=...

## Security and Hosting Compatibility Update - October 2023

### Summary

Hardened authentication by removing the admin backdoor, fixed server-only crashes in password hashing, and made the app fully host-agnostic. Ensured favicon is always served to eliminate 404s.

### Key Changes

* Removed hardcoded admin credentials and backdoor flow from login API
* Replaced browser-only `btoa` usage with Node-safe `Buffer` in auth utils
* Added explicit favicon handling via an app route to avoid `/favicon.ico` 404s
* Removed Vercel-specific Analytics component
* Added icons metadata in layout

### Files Modified

* `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` – removed admin bypass
* `lib/auth/client-utils.ts` – Node-safe base64 hashing
* `app/layout.tsx` – removed `@vercel/analytics/next`; added `metadata.icons`
* `app/favicon.ico/route.ts` – redirects to `public/placeholder-logo.png`
* `next.config.mjs` – added rewrite for `/favicon.ico`

## Auth, Email, and Logging Overhaul - October 2023

### Summary

Strengthened authentication and email flows to use MongoDB exclusively. Standardized email sending from a configurable no-reply domain and added centralized admin logging via email.

### Key Changes

* Enforced MongoDB-only user operations (signup, login, verify-email, forgot-password, reset-password)
* Converted all auth routes to async/await
* Added admin log emails for key events (username only, no passwords/emails)
* Standardized sender via `EMAIL_FROM` or fallback to `no-reply@nazzelandavionna.site`
* OTP and verification emails sent via server SMTP only

### Files Modified

* `lib/db/storage.ts` – MongoDB-only methods for users/posts/sessions
* `lib/email.ts` – unified SMTP transporter, `sendAdminLog` helper, professional HTML templates
* `app/api/auth/*` – signup/login/verify-email/forgot-password/reset-password async MongoDB ops with admin logging
* `app/api/forum/posts/*` – create/view/share/react posts, create/react replies with admin log emails

## Forum Page Error Fix - October 2023

### Issue

`/forum` page showed "Application error: a client side exception has occurred"

### Root Cause

* Missing MongoDB connection
* Improper async/await in API routes
* `/api/users/profile` expected `userId` parameter but was called without it

### Files Modified

* `lib/db/mongodb.ts` – singleton connection manager, auto-index creation, proper error handling
* `lib/db/storage.ts` – refactored to use MongoDB operations; graceful fallback warnings only
* `app/api/users/profile/route.ts` – supports authenticated and public profile fetching
* `app/api/users/online/route.ts` – async/await applied, proper error handling
* `app/api/forum/posts/route.ts` – async/await applied for get/save posts
* `app/api/forum/posts/[id]/*/route.ts` – async/await applied for view/share/react posts and replies
* `lib/email.ts` – Gmail SMTP integration with professional HTML templates, verification/reset/welcome emails

---

## Results

### ✅ Issues Resolved

* Forum page loads without client-side exceptions
* All API routes async/await-compliant
* User auth and profile management functional
* Forum posts/reactions/sharing working
* Professional email system fully implemented with Gmail/custom domain
* Email verification and password reset functioning

### ✅ Development Experience Improved

* Clear console warnings for fallback storage
* Graceful error handling
* Easy transition to production MongoDB
* Professional email templates
* Custom domain email integration
* Test email functionality included

---

### Testing Instructions

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Test forum page: `/forum` loads, posts/reactions/share working
3. Test email system: sign up, verify email, forgot password, welcome emails
4. Check console for errors or fallback warnings

---

### Future Considerations

* Production deployment: configure `MONGODB_URI` with MongoDB Atlas
* In-memory storage resets on server restart; not for production
* Consider Redis for session management
* Add proper logging and monitoring
