# Change Logs

## Forum Page Error Fix - October 2025

### Issue Description
The `/forum` page was showing "Application error: a client side exception has occurred" error when accessed.

### Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by several issues in the API routes and database connection:

1. **Missing MongoDB Connection**: The storage system was throwing an error when `MONGODB_URI` environment variable was not set
2. **Missing async/await**: Several API routes were not properly using async/await for database operations
3. **API Route Issues**: The `/api/users/profile` route expected a `userId` parameter but the forum page was calling it without parameters for authenticated users

### Technical Details

#### Fallback Storage System
```typescript
// In-memory fallback storage for development
const inMemoryStorage = {
  users: new Map<string, User>(),
  posts: new Map<string, ForumPost>(),
  replies: new Map<string, ForumReply>(),
  sessions: new Map<string, Session>(),
  messages: new Map<string, PrivateMessage>(),
  typingStatuses: new Map<string, TypingStatus>(),
  albums: new Map<string, GalleryAlbum>(),
}
```

#### Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
async getUsers(): Promise<User[]> {
  try {
    const collection = await this.getCollection<User>("users")
    return await collection.find({}).toArray()
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn("MongoDB not available, using in-memory storage")
    return Array.from(inMemoryStorage.users.values())
  }
}
```

#### Professional Email System
```typescript
// Gmail SMTP Configuration
export const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: "gmail",
  host: "smtp.gmail.com",
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.GMAIL_USER || "donotreply@nazzelandavionna.site",
    pass: process.env.GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD,
  },
})

// Email Templates with Professional Styling
export const emailTemplates = {
  emailVerification: (username: string, verificationCode: string) => ({
    subject: "✨ Welcome to Nazzel & Avionna's Love Story - Verify Your Email",
    html: `...professional HTML template...`
  }),
  passwordReset: (username: string, resetCode: string) => ({
    subject: "🔐 Password Reset Request - Nazzel & Avionna's Love Story",
    html: `...professional HTML template...`
  }),
  welcomeMember: (username: string) => ({
    subject: "🎉 Welcome to Our Community! - You're Now a Verified Member",
    html: `...professional HTML template...`
  })
}
```

### Testing Instructions

1. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Forum Page:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/forum`
   - Verify page loads without errors
   - Test creating posts (when logged in)
   - Test reactions and sharing functionality

3. **Test Email System:**
   - Set up environment variables (GMAIL_USER, GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD)
   - Test email verification: Sign up with a new account
   - Test password reset: Use forgot password feature
   - Test welcome email: Verify email to become member
   - Test forum notifications: Get mentioned in posts

4. **Verify Console:**
   - Check browser console for any remaining errors
   - Check server console for fallback storage warnings
   - Check email sending logs for successful delivery

### Future Considerations

- **Production Deployment**: When ready for production, set up MongoDB Atlas and configure `MONGODB_URI` environment variable
- **Data Persistence**: In-memory storage is temporary and resets on server restart
- **Performance**: Consider implementing Redis for session management in production
- **Monitoring**: Add proper logging and monitoring for production environment

### Environment Variables Required for Production

```env
# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/nazzelandavionnadb?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Email Configuration
GMAIL_USER=donotreply@nazzelandavionna.site
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_gmail_app_password

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://nazzelandavionna.site
```
