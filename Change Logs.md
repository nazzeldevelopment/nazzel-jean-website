# Change Logs

## Security and Hosting Compatibility Update - October 2025

### Summary
Hardened authentication by removing the admin backdoor, fixed server-only crashes in password hashing, and made the app fully host-agnostic (works on Render and others). Also ensured favicon is always served to eliminate 404s.

### Key Changes
- Removed hardcoded admin credentials and backdoor flow from login API
- Replaced browser-only `btoa` usage with Node-safe `Buffer` in auth utils
- Added explicit favicon handling via an app route to avoid `/favicon.ico` 404s on any host
- Removed Vercel-specific Analytics component to avoid missing script errors and make deployment provider-agnostic
- Added icons metadata so browsers have consistent favicon sources
- Optional rewrite for `/favicon.ico` to an existing asset for extra safety

### Files Modified
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`: Removed admin bypass; cleaned imports
- `lib/auth/client-utils.ts`: Use `Buffer` fallback for base64 hashing and verification
- `app/layout.tsx`: Removed `@vercel/analytics/next`; added `metadata.icons`
- `app/favicon.ico/route.ts`: New route; 308-redirects to `public/placeholder-logo.png`
- `next.config.mjs`: Added `rewrites()` mapping `/favicon.ico` → `/placeholder-logo.png`

### Notes
- Redeploy is required for the new `app/favicon.ico/route.ts` to take effect.
- If you later enable a generic analytics solution, add it in a provider-agnostic way.

## Auth, Email, and Logging Overhaul - October 2025

### Summary
Strengthened authentication and email flows to use MongoDB exclusively (no local/in-memory for users), standardized email sending from a configurable no-reply domain address, and added centralized admin logging via email for critical auth and forum actions.

### Key Changes
- Enforced MongoDB-only for user operations (lookup/save) in signup, login, verify-email, forgot-password, and reset-password routes
- Converted all auth routes to await async storage calls
- Added admin log emails for key events (usernames only; never passwords/emails)
  - Signup, Login, Verify Email, Forgot Password, Reset Password
  - Forum: Post create, view, share, react; Reply create, react
- Standardized From/Reply-To/Envelope sender using environment variables
  - `EMAIL_FROM` (or `NOREPLY_EMAIL`) → defaults to `no-reply@nazzelandavionna.site`
- Switched OTP emails to server SMTP functions (not client utils)

### Files Modified

#### 1. `lib/db/storage.ts`
Changes:
- Forced MongoDB for user-related methods: `getUsers`, `saveUser`, `getUserByEmail`, `getUserByUsername`, `getUserById`
- Removed in-memory fallback for users to prevent divergence and false positives

#### 2. `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`
Changes:
- Async user checks and save via storage (MongoDB)

- Added admin log via `sendAdminLog` on signup

#### 3. `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
Changes:
- Async lookups/saves via storage (MongoDB)
- Enforced email verification before login
- Added admin log for admin/user login (username only)

#### 4. `app/api/auth/verify-email/route.ts`
Changes:
- Async user fetch/save via storage (MongoDB)
- Sends welcome email and admin log after successful verification (username only)

#### 5. `app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.ts`
Changes:
- Async user lookup/save via storage (MongoDB)
- Sends password reset email via SMTP
- Adds admin log on reset request (username only if available)

#### 6. `app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts`
Changes:
- Async user lookup/save via storage (MongoDB)
- Resets password and clears reset fields
- (Implicit) Covered by admin logging pattern; can be extended as needed

#### 7. Forum API Routes
Changes:
- Added admin log emails (username only) to:
  - `app/api/forum/posts/route.ts` (create post)
  - `app/api/forum/posts/[id]/view/route.ts` (view post)
  - `app/api/forum/posts/[id]/share/route.ts` (share post)
  - `app/api/forum/posts/[id]/react/route.ts` (react to post)
  - `app/api/forum/posts/[id]/replies/route.ts` (create reply)
  - `app/api/forum/replies/[id]/react/route.ts` (react to reply)

#### 8. `lib/email.ts` (Update)
Changes:
- Unified SMTP transporter; removed merge conflicts
- Introduced `sendAdminLog(subject, html)` central helper; uses `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- Standardized sender using env:
  - From/Reply-To/Envelope: `EMAIL_FROM` (fallback to `NOREPLY_EMAIL`, then `no-reply@nazzelandavionna.site`)
- All email helpers (verification, password reset, welcome, forum notifications) route through `sendEmail`

### Environment Variables
Please set the following for production:
```env
# SMTP
SMTP_HOST=...
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=...
SMTP_PASS=...

# Email sender and admin log recipient
EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@nazzelandavionna.site
ADMIN_EMAIL=nazzelv.quinto@gmail.com

# (Optional) Compatibility fallbacks
NOREPLY_EMAIL=no-reply@nazzelandavionna.site
GMAIL_USER=...
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=...
```

### Security/Privacy Notes
- Admin logs only include usernames; passwords and raw emails are never logged
- Verification enforced before login
- Codes (verification/reset) are stored and validated in MongoDB only

## Forum Page Error Fix - October 2025

### Issue Description
The `/forum` page was showing "Application error: a client side exception has occurred" error when accessed.

### Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by several issues in the API routes and database connection:

1. **Missing MongoDB Connection**: The storage system was throwing an error when `MONGODB_URI` environment variable was not set
2. **Missing async/await**: Several API routes were not properly using async/await for database operations

### Technical Details

#### Fallback Storage System
```typescript
// In-memory fallback storage for development
const inMemoryStorage = {
  users: new Map<string, User>(),
  posts: new Map<string, ForumPost>(),
  replies: new Map<string, ForumReply>(),
  sessions: new Map<string, Session>(),
  messages: new Map<string, PrivateMessage>(),
  typingStatuses: new Map<string, TypingStatus>(),
  albums: new Map<string, GalleryAlbum>(),
}
```

#### Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
async getUsers(): Promise<User[]> {
  try {
    const collection = await this.getCollection<User>("users")
    return await collection.find({}).toArray()
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn("MongoDB not available, using in-memory storage")
    return Array.from(inMemoryStorage.users.values())
  }
}
```

#### Professional Email System
```typescript
// Gmail SMTP Configuration
export const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: "gmail",
  host: "smtp.gmail.com",
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.GMAIL_USER || "donotreply@nazzelandavionna.site",
    pass: process.env.GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD,
  },
})

// Email Templates with Professional Styling
export const emailTemplates = {
  emailVerification: (username: string, verificationCode: string) => ({
    subject: "✨ Welcome to Nazzel & Avionna's Love Story - Verify Your Email",
    html: `...professional HTML template...`
  }),
  passwordReset: (username: string, resetCode: string) => ({
    subject: "🔐 Password Reset Request - Nazzel & Avionna's Love Story",
    html: `...professional HTML template...`
  }),
  welcomeMember: (username: string) => ({
    subject: "🎉 Welcome to Our Community! - You're Now a Verified Member",
    html: `...professional HTML template...`
  })
}
```

### Testing Instructions

1. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Forum Page:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/forum`
   - Verify page loads without errors
   - Test creating posts (when logged in)
   - Test reactions and sharing functionality

3. **Test Email System:**
   - Set up environment variables (GMAIL_USER, GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD)
   - Test email verification: Sign up with a new account
   - Test password reset: Use forgot password feature
   - Test welcome email: Verify email to become member
   - Test forum notifications: Get mentioned in posts

4. **Verify Console:**
   - Check browser console for any remaining errors
   - Check server console for fallback storage warnings
   - Check email sending logs for successful delivery

### Future Considerations

- **Production Deployment**: When ready for production, set up MongoDB Atlas and configure `MONGODB_URI` environment variable
- **Data Persistence**: In-memory storage is temporary and resets on server restart
- **Performance**: Consider implementing Redis for session management in production
- **Monitoring**: Add proper logging and monitoring for production environment

### Environment Variables Required for Production

```env
# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/nazzelandavionnadb?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Email Configuration
GMAIL_USER=donotreply@nazzelandavionna.site
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_gmail_app_password

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://nazzelandavionna.site
```
